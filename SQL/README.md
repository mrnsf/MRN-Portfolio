### Technical Competencies

```sql
-- Example of advanced SQL techniques covered:
WITH performance_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        department_id,
        employee_id,
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
    FROM employees
)
SELECT 
    d.department_name,
    pm.employee_id,
    pm.salary,
    AVG(pm.salary) OVER (PARTITION BY pm.department_id) as dept_avg
FROM performance_metrics pm
JOIN departments d ON pm.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE pm.rank <= 3;
```

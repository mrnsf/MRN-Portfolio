## 🛠️ Technical Skills

![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-276DC3?style=for-the-badge&logo=r&logoColor=white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)
![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)
![Excel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Excel-217346?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-excel&logoColor=white)

### 📊 R
Comfortable with advanced techniques such as **causal inference, forecasting, economic modeling, and multivariate analysis**. Experienced in building statistical models that uncover relationships in data and support real-world decision-making. Skilled in producing polished visualizations with **ggplot2** to communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.

### 🐍 Python
Applied mainly for **data wrangling, automation, and quick exploratory analysis**. Proficient with **Pandas and NumPy** for data manipulation, and **Matplotlib** for simple, effective visualizations. While not my deepest expertise, I use Python reliably to get the job done when needed, especially for tasks that complement my R and SQL workflows.

### 🗄️ SQL
Strong ability to **design, query, and manage relational databases**. Skilled in writing efficient queries to extract, combine, and transform data from multiple sources, ensuring clean and consistent results. SQL often serves as the backbone of my analytical work, feeding data into R or Excel for deeper modeling and presentation.

### 📊 Excel
Highly experienced with Excel for **analysis, reporting, and client-facing outputs**. Proficient in pivot tables, formulas, and data visualization, using Excel as both a standalone tool and a complement to SQL and R. Its accessibility and flexibility make it one of my most reliable tools for translating analysis into clear, actionable insights.

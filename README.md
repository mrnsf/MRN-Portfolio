## Current Projects

**Aqui** - Local entrepreneur discovery platform | [get-aqui.com/about](https://get-aqui.com/about)  
Our mission is to empower local entrepreneurs by providing a platform that makes it easy for them to be discovered. We believe in the power of local economies and the unique cultural experiences that street vendors bring to our cities. We aim to bridge the gap between vendors and customers, making it simple, fun, and efficient to find and support businesses in your neighborhood.

**Watcher** - Security-first web app for vibe coders and small teams  
Watcher is a security-first web app that scans your codebase, highlights risks, and guides fixes — helping vibe coders and small teams ship safely. Indie developers and small teams often overlook security when shipping fast. Existing tools are noisy, complex, and not tuned for their workflows. Watcher provides a simple loop: connect repo → index deeply → receive clear security findings in a chat interface → fix with your dev → resync and scan again. Focused purely on web, app, and storage security.

## Academic Coursework

**Advanced Economics**: Econometric Methods, Time Series Analysis, Mathematical Economics, Causal Inference  
**Data Science**: Data Mining, Multivariate Analysis, Business Statistics  
**Analytics Programming**: R Programming, SQL Database Management, Business Applications
